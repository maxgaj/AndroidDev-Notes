Lesson 12 - Completing the UI

1. Introduction
	In almost all the previous lessons, you are focusing on building the functionality
		while we provided you with pre-built UI screens
		These next two lessons will switch our attention into turning a simple app that just works
		into a professional-looking app that looks pretty user-friendly
		You'll get to try different views, view group, organize them in alternative layouts and perform data binding
		You will also get to design your app in a way that's accessible to people with visual and physical limitations
		and those who speak other language
		you'll get to build notifications in Android, as well
		In the next lesson, we'll talk more about making our design even prettier
		by using the right colors and font styles
		as weel as creatinf touch selector

4. Constraint Layout
	Constraint Layout allows you to create a complex layout without having to nest view group inside each other
	It's very similar to a relative layout in that other views are laid out relative to each other 
		or to the parent layout itself
	But the underlying structured of a constraint layout is much simpler
	It usually outperforms other layout types

14. Accessibility and Internationalization
	If your goal is to make an app that goes fire on and get used by millions of users
	you should think about accessibility and internationalization
	Accessibility means your app can be utilized by users that have visual or physical limitation
	that prevent them from fully seen or using a touch screen
	Internationnaly friendly means that your app can be translated to other languages
	without effecting the integrity and layout design
	
18. Responsive Design
	A responsive UI i simply a UI that reacts to the amount of available space in the screen
	we will talk a lot more about how to update our designs to match diferent screen sizes in the next lesson
	But for now, let's at least look at what happens when you simply turn the phone into landscape mode
	Android offers something called alternate layouts
		Basically, you can create an entire new XML layout file only for landscape mode
